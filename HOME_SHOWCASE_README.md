# Home wiring for Scroll Showcase

This patch wires the scroll-driven "How it works" animation directly onto your homepage
and adds a "See it in 10 seconds â†“" jump link in the hero.

## Files included (drop-in)
- components/HomeShowcase.tsx
- app/page.tsx (replaces the homepage to include the anchored section)

## Requirements
- You already added the scroll animation bundle (components/ScrollShowcase.tsx).
- Tailwind classes used here already exist in your project.

## Install
Paste these files into your repo at the same paths, commit & push. That's it.
